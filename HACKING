Internals
=========

Debugging
---------

First, install the necessary software to get the GPS tracker working on Windows
(drivers and @trip PC from
http://global.mobileaction.com/download/i-gotU_download.jsp). Restart your PC,
then play around with the GPS tracker, try to record some points, and make sure
you can actually read them into @trip PC. Close @trip PC and disconnect the
tracker.

To make @trip PC output debug information, create the two directories
'C:\GT_DEBUG_LOG' and 'C:\GT_DATA_LOG'. Because we want to know what is sent to
the serial port created by the device driver for the GPS tracker, download
portmon (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896644.aspx) and
start it. Set "Edit->Max Output Bytes" to 4096, select "Options->Show Hex", and
choose the correct com port for the tracker in "Capture->Ports".

Attach the GPS tracker to the PC, start @trip PC and download the complete data
on the tracker.

'C:\GT_DATA_LOG\Data_*.csv' now contain decoded data logs of all downloaded
trackpoints, 'C:\GT_DEBUG_LOG\GT.log' contains debug messages of the driver dll
and the portmon log contains all communication with the device. Use
----
    src/serialdecoder/serialdecoder.py portmon.log
---- 
to get an idea what the commands mean.

GPSD support
------------

For gpsd support, try the navman kernel driver to get an USB serial device at
something like /dev/ttyUSB0. Do this before you plug the device in:
----
    sudo modprobe navman
    echo -n "0x0df7 0x0900" | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/navman/new_id
----
and then plug your device in. You now have read-only access to the device and
you can use it as an nmea data source for gpsd.

USB transport
-------------

The i-gotU GT-120 has a vendor id of 0x0df7 and a product id of 0x0900.

Data can be read from interrupt endpoint 0x81 with sth. like
----
    usb_interrupt_read(handle, 0x81, buf, size, timeout);
----

Writes are done with control messages:
----
    usb_control_msg(handle, 0x21, 0x09, 0x0200, 0x0000, data, size, timeout);
----

This must be done asynchronously, i.e., writes should be independent from
reads. If one read completes, the next one must be started immediately.

There seems to be a firmware bug that may send responses twice for some
commands. If the transmission is done synchronously, it will not be possible to
detect and discard superfluous bytes. This is especially important on Mac OS X,
as the USB interrupt transfers there ignore the timeout given.

Binary protocol
---------------

Commands are sent in 8 byte chunks. Each chunk is acknowledged by the gps
tracker. Most commands consist of 2 chunks. The last byte of all commands
contains a checksum (SS) so that the sum of all command bytes is zero.

Before each command, the connection is cleared, i.e., all superfluous bytes
that are still in the input buffer are discarded.

Purge
-----

@trip PC reads the first 0x10 bytes of each block starting from the end of the
flash (0x0FF000 or 0x1FF000) and stops at the first block where these bytes are
not 0xFF. Each block but the first one is then purged according to the
following pseudo code:
