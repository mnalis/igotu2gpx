Dependencies
------------

To compile igotu2gpx, you need:
- qt4 (http://www.qtsoftware.com/)
- boost (http://www.boost.org/)
- boost-program-options (http://www.boost.org/, included with boost)
- libusb 0.1 (on Linux and Mac OS X systems, http://libusb.sourceforge.net/)
- chrpath (on Linux, optional, makes it possible to run the program without
  installation)

On a Ubuntu system, this should get you the dependencies:
    sudo aptitude install libqt4-dev libboost-dev libboost-program-options-dev \
        libusb-dev chrpath

Compiling
---------

On a Linux system, you can compile with:
    qmake && make && sudo make install
If you get error messages about "Unknown test functions" from qmake, try
    qmake-qt4 && make && sudo make install
instead.

On a Mac OS X system, a bit more work is necessary. Copy the file
localconfig-template.pri to localconfig.pri, uncomment the lines with macx:...
and adjust the paths so that they match your installation. Afterwards, try:
    qmake -spec macx-g++ && make && sudo make install
which should provide you with a working installation in /usr/local.

On Microsoft Windows with MinGW, do something similar. Copy the file
localconfig-template.pri to localconfig.pri, uncomment the lines with win32:...
and adjust the paths so that they match your installation. Afterwards, try the
following from the Qt command line:
    qmake && make && make install
which should provide you with a working installation in bin/debug-installed.
