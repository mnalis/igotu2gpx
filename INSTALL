Install instructions
====================

Dependencies
------------

To compile igotu2gpx, you need:

- qt4 (http://www.qtsoftware.com/)
- boost (http://www.boost.org/)
- boost-program-options (http://www.boost.org/, included with boost)
- libusb 0.1 (on Linux, http://libusb.sourceforge.net/)
- libusb 0.1.13 (on Mac OS X systems, http://www.ellert.se/twain-sane/)
- chrpath (on Linux, optional, makes it possible to run the program without
  installation)

On a Ubuntu system, this should get you the dependencies:
----
    sudo aptitude install libqt4-dev libboost-dev libboost-program-options-dev \
        libusb-dev chrpath
----

Compiling
---------

Linux
~~~~~

On a Linux system, you can compile with:
----
    qmake && make && sudo make install
----

If you get error messages about "Unknown test functions" from qmake, try
qmake-qt4 instead of qmake.

If you are on a 64bit system and your distributor ships 64bit libraries in
/lib64 and /usr/lib64, use "qmake LIBDIR=/usr/local/lib64".

If you use a compiler older than gcc 4.0.0, use "qmake CLEBS=novisibility".

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

On a Mac OS X system, a bit more work is necessary. Copy the file
localconfig-template.pri to localconfig.pri, uncomment the lines with macx:...
and adjust the paths so that they match your installation. Afterwards, try:
----
    qmake -spec macx-g++ && make && sudo make install
----
which should provide you with a working installation in /usr/local.

Microsoft Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Microsoft Windows you can compile igotu2gpx with MinGW. Copy the file
localconfig-template.pri to localconfig.pri, uncomment the lines with win32:...
and adjust the paths so that they match your installation. Afterwards, try the
following from the Qt command line:
----
    qmake && make && make install
----
which should provide you with a working installation in bin/debug-installed.

Running
-------

To get started, try:
----
    igotugui
    man igotu2gpx
    igotu2gpx info
    igotu2gpx dump
----
